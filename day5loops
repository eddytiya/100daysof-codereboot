###############basics FOR loop
  #For Loop with Lists
fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear","banana"]
for fruit in fruits:
  #print(fruits)#prints list 4 times
  print(fruit)#prients each element of the list
  print(fruit + " Pie")



  ##############AVG height
  (what i did)
  # Input a Python list of student heights
student_heights = input().split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆
  
# Write your code below this row 👇

for student in student_heights:
    add=sum(student_heights)
    print(f"total height ={add}")
    studlen=len(student_heights)
    print(f"number of students ={studlen}")
    avd_heights=add/studlen
    print(f"average heights ={avd_heights}")

  (correct way)
  # Input a Python list of student heights
student_heights = input().split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆
  
# Write your code below this row 👇
total_height = 0
for height in student_heights:
  total_height += height
print(total_height)

# find number of students
number_of_students = 0
for student in student_heights:
  number_of_students += 1
print(number_of_students)

# find average heights:
average_height = round((total_height / number_of_students))
print(f"The average height is {average_height} cm")


  ########################################highest mks
  # Input a list of student scores
student_scores = input().split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])

# Write your code below this row 👇
high_scores=0
for score in student_scores:
